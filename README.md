# My Contacts
(made with gpt based on our discussions)

## Overview
This project is a **Contacts Management Application** designed to help users organize and manage their contacts efficiently. The application is built using **React** with **TypeScript** and **styled-components** for styling. The main goal of this project is to explore and apply advanced concepts in **frontend development**, focusing on UI/UX design, state management, component reusability, and modern web development best practices.

This was made following Mateus Silva's JStack course.

### Key Features:
1. **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Contacts:**
   - Add new contacts with essential details like name, email, and phone number.
   - Edit existing contacts using an intuitive modal interface.
   - Delete contacts with confirmation dialogs for user safety.

2. **Search and Sort Contacts:**
   - Users can search for contacts using the search bar.
   - Contacts can be sorted by different attributes (e.g., name).

3. **Dynamic Styling:**
   - Styled-components allow for flexible and scalable component styling.
   - Themes are utilized to ensure consistency and adaptability across the app.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - The application is designed to work seamlessly across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Educational Objectives
This application serves as a learning project aimed at mastering several aspects of modern web development. The following points highlight the educational value derived from building this app:

### 1. **React and TypeScript Integration**
   - Exploring how **TypeScript** enhances code quality by providing static typing and error checking at compile time.
   - Utilizing interfaces and types to define props and application states for better scalability and maintainability.

### 2. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - Building reusable and modular components such as `ContactForm`, `ContactCard`, and `Modal` to promote clean and efficient code.
   - Passing data between components using props and context.

### 3. **CSS-in-JS with Styled-Components**
   - Learning how to style components dynamically using **props** and theming.
   - Managing complex styles while maintaining a clear structure.

### 4. **React Router**
   - Navigating between different views (e.g., home, add contact, edit contact) using **React Router v7**.
   - Passing data between routes via the `state` property and understanding how to retrieve and handle it effectively.

### 5. **State Management and Props**
   - Using React's state and props efficiently to manage dynamic data, such as contact information.
   - Implementing controlled components for form handling.

### 6. **User Experience (UX) Design**
   - Creating user-friendly interfaces with features like modals for editing or confirming deletions.
   - Ensuring accessibility by providing clear visual cues and intuitive navigation.

### 7. **Debugging and Problem Solving**
   - Addressing common challenges, such as managing stacking contexts with `z-index` in CSS and ensuring modal overlays function correctly.
   - Debugging dynamic styling issues and learning from real-world scenarios.
